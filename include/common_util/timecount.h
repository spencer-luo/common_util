 * @brief A simple time counter class to measure the execution time of a function.
 *
 * Measure the execution time of a function by using the feature that a class instance object automatically destructs when it exits it's scope.
 *
 * The time precision is microsecondï¼Œuse monotone increment time, which presents the duration time between the system start time and the current time.
