## 1.1. Windows

### 1.1.1. Modify Scripts

**1.1 Set the Generator**

Open the ./script/build.bat file and replace the following line:

```bash
set generator="Visual Studio 14 2015"
```

with the corresponding version of Visual Studio installed on your machine. It can be one of the following values:

```bash
Visual Studio 14 2015
Visual Studio 15 2017
Visual Studio 16 2019
Visual Studio 17 2022
```

You can use the ```cmake -G``` command to view more supported generators.

**1.2 Set the Number of CPU Cores**

Open the ./script/build.bat file and replace the following line:

```bash
set cpu_cores=6
```

with the number of CPU cores on your machine.

To check the number of CPU cores:

```bash
1. Open cmd, then input:
wmic
2. Input:
cpu get NumberOfCores
```

### 1.1.2. Compilation

```bash
./script/build.bat build [x86|x64] [release|rls|debug|dbg]
# Debug模式
# ./script/build.bat build dbg
```

- Argument 1: Platform type of the target program to build, x86 means 32-bit program, and x64 means 64-bit program. 
- Argument 2: Configuration type of the target program to build, release or rls means the release version, and debug or dbg means the debug version.

### 1.1.3. Run

Run the results compiled in step 2.

```bash
./script/build.bat run
```

### 1.1.4. Clean Cache

Clear the cache from the compilation in step 2.

```bash
./script/build.bat clean
```

## 1.2. Unix-like

Including Linux/macOS and other Unix-like systems.

### 1.2.1. Compilation

```bash
./script/build.sh build [release|rls|debug|dbg]
# Debug模式
# ./script/build.sh build dbg
```

### 1.2.2. Run

Run the results compiled in step 1.

```bash
./script/build.sh run
```

### 1.2.3. Clean Cache

Clear the cache from the compilation in step 1.

```bash
